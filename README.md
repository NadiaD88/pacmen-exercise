Pacmen Exercise

Description:
This project has multiple pacmen, the pacmen run at a random speed that you can add to the screen for a fun interactive experience. 

How to Run:
  Please click on "PacMen Exercise" once you are directed to the PacMen page
        press "Start" then "Add Pacmen" you are able to add multiple Pacmen.
        
 Roadmap to future improvments:
 
 I plan on stylizing this project a bit more, perhaps adding some background elements and addtional functionality.
